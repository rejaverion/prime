I'm an electronics student and a programming noob. I have this python project on face detection using opencv cascade classifiers.
the problem is I'm dealing wiht thermal images. There are no pre-trained Haar or LBP classifiers for detecting faces in thermal images.
So now I'm forced to train my own cascade classifier to do that. Every tutorial I come across requires to download files in github repos.
